# NomNom

NomNom is a short video game created using SDL2 and C++. It follows a simple story-line and goes through multiple mini-games that the user can play and accumulate points with. The number of points determines the ending of the story. SDL2 was used to produce the graphics and user interface of the game. Some of the included games were Blackjack, Sudoku, a few riddles, and Hangman. I personally worked with the Blackjack and one of the riddles more. I also created the backgrounds for those games as well. This was one of my favorite projects, as it involved multiple different games, and resulted in an actual final game that I could interact with and show to others as well.
